# JPA to Spring Events

This project will convert JPA events (create, update, remove) to Spring.

A typical use case would be if you wanted to received a notification whenever an entity has been modified
and do some processing afterwards like triggering a script.

## Execution

Run mvn test and the spring events should be visible in the log.

For CDI events see https://github.com/czetsuya/jpa-to-cdi-events.
